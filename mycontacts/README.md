# TDDD27_2020_MyContacts 

MyContacts is a website for storing and managing your contacts. This project is a part of the course TDDD27 - Advanced Web Programming at Linkï¿½ping University.

### Functional specification

The purpose of this app is to store and manage personal contacts online. Think of it similar to [Google Contacts](https://contacts.google.com/) but with more options. Rather than just having a list of contacts we want to create a better user experience for reading and managing contact information. On the website, it should be possible to add, delete, edit, and filter contacts. It should also be possible to store information such as an address, phone number, social media, work, etc. The core function of the app is to display all the contact information in an easy-to-read and interactive environment.

### Technological specification
